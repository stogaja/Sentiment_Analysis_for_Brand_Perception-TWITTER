## Introduction
In today's digital age, understanding public sentiment and attitudes towards specific topics or brands in social media is crucial for businesses and organizations. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data analytics to gain insights into public sentiment and attitudes on social media platforms.

## Business Problem
The primary business problem addressed in this project is to analyze and understand sentiment patterns on social media platforms. By doing so, businesses can make informed decisions, engage with their audience effectively, and adapt their strategies based on public perception.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze sentiment patterns:** Utilize NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on social media text data.
2. **Visualize sentiment trends:** Create informative data visualizations to represent sentiment trends over time.
3. **Extract insights from the data:** Dive deep into the sentiment analysis results to extract valuable insights.

## Data
- The project uses a dataset from Twitter containing tweets, entities, and sentiment labels.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, duplicates, and text cleaning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA includes visualizations of sentiment distribution, entity distribution, sentiment distribution by entity, and text length analysis.

## NLP Preprocessing
- Text data undergoes NLP preprocessing, including removing special characters, tokenization, converting to lowercase, lemmatization, and stopwords removal.

## Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment analysis is performed using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- Sentiments are categorized into positive, negative, and neutral.
- Sentiment distribution is visualized.

## Modeling 
- A sentiment classification model is built using Logistic Regression.
- Data is split into training and testing sets, and features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.
- The model is trained and evaluated for sentiment classification.

## Recommendations
- Continuous monitoring of social media sentiment towards brands or topics.
- Tailoring engagement strategies based on sentiment.
- Using sentiment insights for content creation and customer feedback.
- Benchmarking sentiment against competitors.
- Real-time monitoring and user engagement.
